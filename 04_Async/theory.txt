Javascript--->Synchronous    }default javascript
          --->Single threaded }

Execution context-->Execute one line of a code at a time
   call stck      Memory heap  

   ==>each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing

Blocking code                   vs    Non Blocking code
-->Block the flow of program         --->doesn't block the program
-->Read file Sync                    --->Read file Async
                                     --=>feels good but fails or can be problematic in some edge use cases
                                    --->like suppose i have to write the user data in some file and while i am 
                                    writing the data the next code(give confirmation message to user) gets executed asynchronously.if some error happened
                                    during wrting then the program which is already executed will not consider this error
                                    so it can create inconsistancy
